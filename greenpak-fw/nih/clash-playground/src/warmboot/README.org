* Multi-boot example for iCE40 IceStick Board

This is a port of the ~icemulti~ example from IceStorm to Clash.

It creates 4 bitstream files and uses the ~icemulti~ tool to package them into a
single image. The bitstreams each blink for a few seconds, before using the
~SB_WARMBOOT~ primitive to pass control to the next image.

This example also features a tiny little [[http://shakebuild.com][Shake]] powered build system which will
package up everything for you and program your board. Simply run:

#+BEGIN_SRC
$ ./build.hs -j4
$ ./build.hs program
#+END_SRC

This will invoke the default target to build a ~./build/config.bin~ image which
can be programmed to the IceStick board. The ~*.rpt~ files under ~./build/~
contain synthesis, placement and timing information.

The ~program~ target will ask you to ~sudo~ in order to write the bitstream to
the device.
